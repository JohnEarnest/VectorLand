VectorLand: WebSockets Edition
==============================

A side experiment was performed to determine whether or not WebSockets and HTML5/JavaScript would be fast enough to handle a VectorLand client. The answer seems to be "sort of, yeah!" Try it yourself!

Compile and run the server:

		javac WebCTFServer.java
		java WebCTFServer

And then open up `vector.html` in your favorite WebSockets-compatible browser.
